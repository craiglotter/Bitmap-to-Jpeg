Bitmap-to-Jpeg
==============

Bitmap to Jpeg tries to convert any image files passed to it into maximum quality jpeg images. Input files are added by drag-and-dropping files on the listbox control. The resulting jpg files are saved in the same location as the source files.  Created by Craig Lotter, October 2006
